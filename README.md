# BBE-analyser
BBE = B.A.(Hons) Business Economics , UOD = University of Delhi (#1 University of India, atleast officially)

This course is really analytical, and in my opinion deserves more recognition. So I am building this project for that awareness for this course.

What am I providing for the students?
-> It is really hard to obtain the exact materials you supposedly NEED. 
-> So I(with some help if someone from the community volunteers) will analyse every subject that is included in course, which will give me a BETTER idea to comment more on this course.

What else?
-> I plan to make a discord server & a subreddit attached to this, so all the course peers can connect with each other.
-> I am leaving space for other prominent courses like BMS & BFIA, which are officially considered 'sister/similar' courses of BBE.

(BMS = Bachelor of Managment Studies, BFIA = Bachelors in Financial Investment Analysis)

To give the course BBE in UOD, a better stand point to receive the recognition it deserves, in comparison to other traditional courses in UOD because of traditional colleges. I decided to fix this dilemma with 2 birds 1 stone. I will create a platform for all BBE students (forum based). By making a place to pool all the resources and use as trade.
